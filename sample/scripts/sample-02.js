The demo uses html5 localStorage to store the state of the dashboard. The source of the demo can be found [here](https://github.com/sdorra/angular-dashboard-framework/tree/master/sample).\n\n## Getting started\n\nInstall bower and grunt:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g bower\nnpm install -g grunt-cli\n```\n\nClone the repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/sdorra/angular-dashboard-framework\ncd angular-dashboard-framework\n```\n\nInstall npm and bower dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save\nbower install\n```\n\nYou can start the sample dashboard, by using the server grunt task:\n\n```bash\ngrunt server\n```\n\nNow you open the sample in your browser at http://localhost:9001/sample\n\nOr you can create a release build of angular-dashboard-framework and the samples:\n\n```bash\ngrunt\ngrunt sample\n```\nThe sample and the final build of angular-dashboard-framework are now in the dist directory."
